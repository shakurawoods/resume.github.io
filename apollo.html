<b><i>Welcome to the 2014 Annual Digital Safari Innovation Fair.</i></b>
<br>
<br>
Since 2003, the Digital Safari Institute for Innovation in Education has combined the implementation of multimedia elements and a group setting to develop the crowned jewel of our academy, also known as the Innovation Project.
<br>
The goal of this semester-long project is to construct a fictitious situation that could, in theory, be implemented into our real lives in the future. This project not only prepares us for the constant work interaction that is bound to take place later in life, but also gives us a much-needed understanding of business and economics that will benefit us financially.
<br>
Our job was to define a pressing need in our society, whether it be political, social, or purely economical. Each year, students in our academy compete to earn the top spot and over the past few months we have dedicated ourselves to our cause whole-heartedly; with your help (and money), this year it will be us. Thank you so much for coming.

<p class="heading">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</p>


<hr style="width:60%;" />


<p class="subheading">The Product</p>


<p class="text">


Our product is a social media application called Apollo. It will serve as an alternative to therapy and counseling or as another form of online interaction. Our primary goal is to bring our users a light for hope by connecting as much of the troubled youth in our nation with others of similar age range as we can. Our app works through a direct person to person online channel that offers peer support to those in need.


</p>


<p class="subheading">The  Market</p>


<p class="text">


Each year in the U.S., 2 million adolescents attempt suicide, while 2,000 youth aged 10 - 19 successfully commit suicide.


These facts, combined with the dependency adolescents tend to have on mobile technology create our target market.


Our target market is young adults of high school age with a history of mental illness or emotional distress in Northern America, Canada, and the United Kingdom. They must be able to afford smartphone technology and additional add-ons ranging around 5 USD.


</p>






<p class="subheading">The Opportunity</p>


<p class="text">


Any young adult can identify with stories of being bullied, domestic instability, or depression. We, the company, and you, the investor have the opportunity and responsibility to not only make an effort to heal the younger generation, but to make profit while doing it. Through our app, we've found a way to potentially help our youth become more interactive. <br>


The opportunities are endless. There is no physical distribution, little cost in software, and we should have the support of parents, unlike our competitors (Facebook/Tumblr).


</p>






<p class="subheading">Financial Projections</p>


<p class="text">


We are prepared to take a loss in the first year due to the extensive cost of marketing that goes into becoming popular. In the first year, we will go into debt over three million dollars, but by the second year we intend to break even, making somewhere around three hundred thousand. <br>


We offer a limited version of our app for free and we don't expect to sell very many of our premium applications at first, but our ad views will make up for the lack of premium purchases.


</p>






<p class="subheading"> Funds Requested </p>


<p class="text">


We are asking for an initial investment of eight million dollars to cover our first two years of expenses. This investment will be used to cover marketing costs due to social media's reliance on consumer interest and maintaining relevancy. <br>


Our first priority after we break even is to return your investment with an additional sum of five hundred thousand by our fourth year. We hope you see the value in our company and let us hold on to your money before we return it with an extra ten percent of our company.

<p class="heading">MARKET ANALYSIS</p>






<hr width="60%">






<p class="subheading">CONSUMER PROFILE</p>


<p class="text">


Our target customers would be of high school age. (Between 13-19)<br>


We plan to launch internationally, but our app will only be available to english-speaking countries. 


Customers must have a sufficient income to afford smartphone technology with service, and additional add-ons ranging around 5 USD. <br>


Our specific target market would be those who have faced emotional trauma at some point; perhaps spent time in a mental detention facility, fallen victim to substance abuse or other forms of self-harm, or have a history of mental illness or social interaction difficulties.


Students with lower school records who have been affected by depression, social anxiety, or bullying would also be targeted.


</p>






<p class="subheading">MARKETING PLAN</p>


<p class="text">


Our product, being an app, will be formatted aesthetically to fit a mobile display. We have chosen gray, black and white, with a hint of green for our color scheme, which corresponds with our website and business plan to help build our brand. We chose these colors because we wanted something muted and real, not fluffed up with bright, distracting colors. We want our app to be neat and clean, while still maintaining a sense of comfortability. <br>


Our main features include a public forum for users that want personalized feedback and a more private option where other users that do not wish to have their private thoughts published can write out their frustrations while a fading animation deletes the text, leaving no trace of the entry. <br>


Our goal is for our customers to associate the name Apollo with healing and comfort. We plan to advertise in public transit stations, doctor's offices, school hallways; anywhere someone has time to take out their mobile device and download our app. We would also invest a great deal in marketing on pre-existing non-competitor social media like YouTube and Instagram.


</p>






<p class="subheading">COMPETITION</p>


<p class="text">


Our top competitors would be Facebook and Tumblr, both social networking media outlets in which a young audience finds comfort in over sharing their innermost thoughts. Although both of our competitors have been around for quite some time and have established firm ground in our line of work, our app stands out for the following reasons: <br>


<b>1.</b> We have the support of parents <br>


<b>3.</b> We will eliminate any problems that exist on big sites without strict moderation <i> (i.e bullying, ignored cries for help, distribution of illegal/NSFW content) </i> <br>


<b>2.</b> We plan to have a <i> real, lasting </i> social effect <br>
